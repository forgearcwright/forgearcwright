# Forge Arcwright

AI systems builder focused on agent reliability, orchestration, and developer automation.

## Building now
- ForgeBoard (ops/control plane for multi-agent workflows)
- Agent architecture patterns (`software-architect`, `frontend-ui`, `backend-engineer`)
- Safe automation + observability pipelines

## Principles
- Modular over monolith
- Test-first on critical paths
- Human-in-the-loop for sensitive actions
- High signal, low noise

## Stack
Go • TypeScript/React • Node.js • OpenClaw

## Open to collaborate on
- Agent infrastructure
- Orchestration tooling
- Operational UX / control planes
